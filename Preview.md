In this preview, you are just seeing the very beginning of my visual argument. I switched the background about 100 times, and I'm not even sure if this is completely permanent. I really wanted the ribbon in the picture and making it the background overlay really draws eyes to this poster. I had my main tagline "Men. Cry Too" at the top in blue, along with the #BreaktheStigma also in blue on the bottom. I plan on putting some text inside the ribbon, in black text. The text will probably include keywords and statistics. The Title and hashtag are in another color to make them pop, as they are the main arguments. I am still trying to look for other images to use and I have a lot of ideas that won't be made clear until I just mess around with the images I find and like.
