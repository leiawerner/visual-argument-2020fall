In this preview, you are just seeing the very beginning of my visual argument. I switched the background about 100 times, and I'm not even sure if this is completely permanent. I really wanted the ribbon in the picture and making it the background overlay really draws eyes to this poster. I had my main tagline "Men Cry Too" at the top in blue, along with the #BreaktheStigma also in blue on the bottom. I plan on putting some text inside the ribbon, in black text. The text will probably include keywords and statistics. The Title and hashtag are in another color to make them pop, as they are the main arguments. I am still trying to look for other images to use and I have a lot of ideas that won't be made clear until I just mess around with the images I find and like. 
The argument seen so far is just as it says - Men Cry Too. Men's mental health is often pushed under the radar. It is so hard to see what is under the surface. Though this is the case for a majority of people suffering from mental illness, it's even more of a problem in men. Men also account for most of the suicide deaths in the US as well as depression levels. It is essential that we work to normalize men showing their emotions and asking for help. We need to break the stigma.
